SURVIVAL TACTICS (Draft 01/21/2022)

PLAYING FIELD

- For 6 to 16 players.
- Game is played on a 17 x 17 grid (Grid should be adjusted down for less players). (15x15 in BETA)


RULES

- All players start at a random location on the grid, and have 3 hearts and 0 Action Points.

- Turn begins when all players have spawn.

- The game is turn based, however players will take their turns on a first come first turn basis.

- The turn changes once all players have taken their turn, or 24 hours (or pre agreed time limit) have passed since the start of the turn.

- Players that miss a turn will lose a heart, if they have no hearts left they will be deemed downed, and their action points, if any, will spawn randomly on the board. Downed players stay on the board.

- Every 24 hours on a weekday (work/school day), everyone will receive 1 Action Point (AP). The time the point is given may vary day to day. (or pre agreed time limit)

- At any turn, you can do one of the five following actions:
    1. Move to an adjacent, unoccupied square (1 AP)
    2. Attack someone who is within your range (1 AP). Attacking someone removes one heart from their health.
    3. Add a heart (3 AP)
    4. Upgrade your range (3 AP)
    5. Do nothing

  And one of these 2 actions
 
    1. Give 1 heart with any player in range. (See below)
    2. Give up to 3 action points to any player in range. (See below)
    
- Hearts in excess of three are held in secret.

- At the start of the game, everyone has a range of 2. That is, they can attack or trade with whomever is in range of them. Upgrading your range increases this by 1 square each time.

- If a player is reduced to 0 hearts, then they are downed. Any action points the downed player had are transferred to the player who downed them. Downed players remain on the board and not removed.

- Downed players can have a heart sent to them. This will revive that player and they will have 1 heart and 0 AP.


ADDITIONAL NOTES

- Downed players form a jury and conduct 2 votes daily:
  1. “The haunting” vote - (In secret) Whomever received most votes will be 'haunted', and not receive any AP for that day.

  2. “The Intercession” vote - (In secret) Any player getting 3 votes will be awarded action points. 
- Once a day, at a random time, a heart will spawn on the field. The first player to move into the square containing the heart will receive that additional heart.

- At random a loot drop of 3 action will spawn randomly on the board. The first player to move into the square containing the loot drop will receive these action points.

- (Optional) Every three turns the grid gets smaller by 2 rows and columns. ie. 17x17 to 15x15
  1. If a downed player is “shrunk out” they loose the ability to revive.
  2. If a player is “shrunk out” they are downed and have no ability to revive.
  3. Hearts and loot “shrunken out” stay out
  
- The game ends when a clear 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place can be determined. Once there are 4 players left, they will meet and see if they can agree on the placing, if not they play on until there are only three. Then the meeting is repeated. This goes on until they agree or only one is left.

- Action points are secret! Probably a good idea to try and hide how many you have.

- You can't win this game without making some friends and probably some enemies.

KEEP IN MIND THIS IS GAME - DON’T GET MAD IRL - KEEP IT IN THE GAME
